Abstract:
Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that develops by mutation of pigment cells known as melanocytes. The survival
rate for melanoma is dependent on the cancer cell mutation. Melanoma is highly curable when detected early. In this
project, we proposed a deep learning system for melanoma detection. This project aims to develop a decision support system in the diagnosis of melanoma and differentiation of malignant skin tumor from two types of benign lesions: (1) Benign nevus, and (2) Seborrheic keratosis.
Two tasks were assigned to the training model, task 1 is to differentiate melanoma from benign skin lesions, and task
2 is to differentiate Nevi from Seborrheic keratoses. Data from results show that an accuracy rate of 78% was
obtained for task 1 and 91% accuracy rate for task 2. The model can be further developed for possible
implementation in clinical diagnosis.
